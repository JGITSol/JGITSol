# Hey, I'm Jędrzej 👋

Field Service Engineer turned AI/ML Developer. I build things that solve real problems—from predictive models for polymer design competitions to full-stack fleet management systems. My background in medical imaging hardware gives me a unique perspective on system reliability and data integrity.

**Tools:** Git • Docker • Jupyter • Linux • CI/CD

## Background

Spent years keeping CT scanners, C-arms, and mobile X-ray systems running in high-stakes environments. That taught me two things: complex systems fail in interesting ways, and good diagnostics beat guesswork every time. Now I apply that same debugging mentality to ML models and production code.

Competed in data science challenges (NeurIPS, Ariel Data Challenge) because I learn best by shipping real solutions under constraints.

## Currently Exploring

- Advanced transformer architectures and their practical applications
- Production ML systems and model deployment patterns
- Building robust data pipelines for real-world datasets
